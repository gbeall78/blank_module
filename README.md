Drupal module stub files.

Each file contains the basic information required to start a new module.
Once pulled run: 

./rename.sh your_modules_name

This will update the files, replacing:
- blank_module -> your_modules_name
- Blank_Module -> Your modules name

Further changes will need to be made manually.
